\section{Discussion: experiences from developing Data Analysis as a Service}
\begin{itemize}
    \item REST easy to work with on all sides (except real-time).

    \blockquote[{\cite[100]{uckelmann-harrison-michahelles:architecting-the-internet-of-things:2011}}]{The central idea of REST revolves around the notion of a resource as \textit{any component of an application that is worth being uniquely identified and linked to}}.

    \item DDP more difficult (but asteroid simplifies everything greatly in JS) \url{https://www.meteor.com/ddp} \url{https://github.com/mondora/asteroid}
    \item All in all, good protocols proved very helpful/important
    \item Security is still a big issue
    \item Privacy is a potential issue
    \item No error handling
    \item Did not do any big data analysis
    \item Treating the providers and consumers of the Internet of Things as any other client (all client-server communication is M2M(?)) proved very simple and helpful
    \item HTTP/2 will be an interesting player once released, as it will provide two-way communication and several requests over the same connection â€“. 
\end{itemize}
