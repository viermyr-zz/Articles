\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Internet of Things (IoT) is perhaps the fastest emerging technology trend at the present time. The IoT technologies and applications are still in their infancy \autocite{xu:internetofthingsasurvey}, and so the academic community must thoroughly address the area. This article...
    \item introduces and describes the most important concepts and areas to address in the field of IoT,
    \item takes a look at the state of the art in the form of a brief literature review (considering mostly other literature reviews and survey papers) and a brief look at papers relevant to building a full/stack application designed for the IoT,
    \item presents the major architectural choices in the development of the research artifact (Data Analysis as a Service - DAaaS) with an integration-oriented focus,
    \item reviews the major untouched areas of interest (mainly security, but also integrations for two-way 2nd and 3rd party integrations),
    \item and finally concludes with a summary of the results and experiences made throughout the rapid development of the prototype and how it fits into the current research on the field of IoT.
\end{itemize}
