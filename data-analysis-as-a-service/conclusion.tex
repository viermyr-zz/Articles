\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Development of the IoT/WoT together with the "regular" web is going to be important
  \item Standards for communication that comply with the current standards of today's Web (and possibly some new ones like COaP) are going to play a major role. Manufacturers, developers, and academics alike should work together towards properly standardising both real-time and after-the-fact communication (in our case DDP and REST, respectively). COaP is a step in the right direction, but components of the Internet of Things may not require two-way communication (like COaP provides) and will thus be held back by this overhead.
  \item Development of a full-stack application for the IoT is 
  \item More focus must be directed at development of full-stack applications
  \begin{itemize}
      \item DAaaS is full-stack JavaScript (which is still not very common)
      \item Relational databases should be considered
      \item Security is another huge issue
      \item Privacy has not been touched – DAaaS is a simple proof of concept on connecting devices to a central server (REST/HTTP POST) and providing means of analysing the data in real-time (DDP) and retrospect (REST/HTTP GET)
  \end{itemize}
  \item HTTP/2 may be an important player in defining the IoT/WoT, and especially when it comes to developing the IoT/WoT together with the Web.
\end{itemize}
