\section{The artifact: Data Analysis as a Service (DAaaS)}
This section considers the artifact developed in the writing of this article: Data Analysis as a Service (DAaaS).
\subsection{Brief description of the implementation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item DAaaS is a full-stack application with several example integrations.
    \item Core application:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Meteor (JS) application built around MongoDB for time series (could/should have used different)
        \item REST endpoints everywhere for simplicity (refer to book Architecting the Internet of Things) â€“ Both provider and consumer endpoints (for pushing and analysing data)
        \item Realtime output endpoints (DDP because there is no de facto standard yet and Meteor provides DDP support out of the box)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Data providers:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Native Android application sending light sensor data (with simple extendability)
        \item Cross-platform mobile app written in Ionic to track toilet visits (extremely simple proof of concept)
        \item Spark Core (\url{http://spark.io}) for any sensor that can be connected to it (e.g., temperature, light, humidity, whatever) with polling rate (e.g., 500 ms between data push)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Data consumers:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Realtime analytics dashboard (just connect via DDP)
        \item REST data providing endpoints
    \end{itemize}
    \item Security is not considered in this application: a simple random token is the only used "authentication", and this is sent in the URL when launching dashboard (refer to Medium.com tragedy)
\end{itemize}
