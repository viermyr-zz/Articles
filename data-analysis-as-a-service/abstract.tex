\begin{abstract}
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is perhaps the fastest emerging new technology trend, and must be deeply addressed through research. While we have many small-scale, single-component solutions for connecting parts of the Internet of Things, we have seen very few research oriented full-stack implementations for gathering, storing, and analysing data. We present Data Analysis as a Service (DAaaS), a full-stack sample implementation of a complete IoT application that accepts, stores, and provides both real-time and static access to the data. The main considerations of DAaaS include storage of time-series data in a regular document database, and machine-to-machine communication through standardised APIs. One common research challenge in the Internet of Things, \textit{security}, is considered only briefly, and is of utmost importance in future research.
