NUIssues is a single-user system, and it would be interesting to explore multi-user issue trackers where the system for example presents several projects at the same time, and allows different teams to visually plan progress and coordinate work.

The \textit{cards} in NUIssues are conventional, rectangular cards. An interesting future project can look into generation of iceberg targets \autocite[91]{wigdow-wixon:brave-nui-world:2011}.
