Conclusion: Stuff has been done, stuff is lacking, more stuff needs to be done in stuff areas

NUIssues is a single-user system, and it would be interesting to explore multi-user issue trackers where the system for example presents several projects at the same time, and allows different teams to visually plan progress and coordinate work.

NUIssues \textbf{only} supports \textit{touch} as natural input. While tracking changes on a user's skin and gaze tracking seem unrelated to the domain, there are several other to explore in future research: Gesture tracking, for instance, makes it possible to expand the application to run on interfaces like \textit{touch walls}. Adding speech recognition or building a Brain Machine Interface can be relevant if the system is to be used by people who are physically incapable of interacting with a touch interface.
